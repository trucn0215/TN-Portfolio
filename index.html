            <h2>About Me</h2>
            <p>
                As an immigration, of course English is not my main language, I have to try and learn as hard as I can to
                get used to new environment in a new country.
                After years trying and learning during school years, I had completed my four years of Bachelor’s Degree
                in Electrical Engineer, and became an American with U.S Citizenship.
                <br>
                After School years, I have been looking for Engineer jobs. It was hard to get and Engineering job at
                that time. I found a job as a Technician in an Aerospace company. I learned and improve my skills while
                working there. With all the time worked hard and improved my skills, I finally found career with
                Manufacturing Engineer at Out of the Box company. New career, new skills, I need to keep learning and
                improve myself. After few years working at Out of the Box, I decided to learn another skills outside of
                Out of the Box. And Web Development coming to my life.
                <br>
                Web Development is an interesting and fun field to learn and explore. Also, when I was in school, I had
                took some coding/programming class, but I still could not get better at it. When I saw Web Development
                course opened, I decided to take a part-time course at UW Boot Camp to give myself a second chance to
                learn and improve my coding skills. Web Development will be my new field that I want to become expert at
                it. Since coding is not my strongest skill, I want to walking through my failure to become better
                person. Like Winston Churchill said “Success is walking from failure to failure with no loss of enthusiasm”
